#Code description:

"equation.R" contains the equation models mentioned in the article, and the least squares calculation function.
"sig.cov.R" contains functions for static mapping of single light intensity.
"clmain.R" computes LR values from potential key QTL sets based on the HDEE.
"clcovar.R" is the AR(1) model used to construct the covariance matrix required in functional mapping.
"logiETR.R", "mitsqP.R" and "korfqN.R" contain mixed probability functions under the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis of functional mapping.
"process.R" is used for transforming LR values into p-values for significance tests.
"network.fun.R" contains functions for network construction.
