#Data description: The data in the folder is ".RData" format and is exclusive to R.

1. "phetable.Rdata" is three sets of phenotypic values of 98 samples under 11 sets of light intensity, with 1-11 listed as ETR values, 12-22 listed as qP values, and 23-33 listed as qN values.
2. "Light.rdata" contains 11 logarithmically processed light intensity values.
3. "genetr.RData" is a potential key QTL set regulating photosynthetic phenotypic ETR, which was screened by functional mapping based on Logistic equation.
    "snpinfoetr.RData" is the information for these potential QTLS.
4. "genqn.RData" is a potential key QTL set regulating photosynthetic phenotypic qN, which was screened by functional mapping based on Mitscherlich equation.
    "snpinfoqn.RData" is the information for these potential QTLS.
5. "genqp.RData" is a potential key QTL set regulating photosynthetic phenotypic qP, which was screened by functional mapping based on Korf equation.
    "snpinfoqp.RData" is the information for these potential QTLS.
